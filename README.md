# English-Dictionary
Introduction:
The English Dictionary project using Java with Binary Search Algorithm is a software development project aimed at building a comprehensive and user-friendly English language dictionary application. The project is designed to help users find the meaning and usage of words in the English language easily and quickly. With the widespread use of the English language globally, the need for a reliable and efficient English dictionary application cannot be overstated.

## Algorithm

Step 1: Define the DictionaryApp class
private String[] words
private String[] meanings
are defined

Step 2: Create the GUI:
Setting them up
private JTextField searchField;
private JTextArea resultArea;
private JButton searchButton;
These components are made by using GUI

Step 3: Implement Binary Search Algorithm:
a.	Initialize two pointers, left and right, to the first and last indices of the sorted array, respectively.

b.	Calculate the middle index of the array as the average of left and right: mid = left + (right - left) / 2.

c.	Compare the target value with the value at the middle index of the array: 
 Three cases are possible
 (i)If the target value is equal to the value at the middle index, the search is successful, and the index is returned. 
 (ii) If the target value is less than the value at the middle index, update the right pointer to be one position to the left of the middle index: right = mid - 1.   (iii) If the target value is greater than the value at the middle index, update the left pointer to be one position to the right of the middle index: left = mid + 1.

d.	Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the left pointer is greater than the right pointer, indicating that the target value is not found in the array.

e.	If the target value is not found in the array, return an appropriate indicator (e.g., null or -1) to denote that the value is not present in the array.

Step 4: Create main function to run the application
new DictionaryApp();
